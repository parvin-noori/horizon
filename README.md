## 🔐 Authentication (Supabase)

This dashboard uses **Supabase Auth** to simulate a real-world authentication flow.

- Authentication is required to access the dashboard
- Login is handled via **Email & Password**
- Supabase returns a **JWT access token**
- The token is stored in **LocalStorage** (demo purpose)
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access

> ⚠️ Note: Due to Supabase access restrictions, a VPN may be required to use the authentication features in some regions

> ⚠️ This authentication flow is implemented **for demo purposes only**.
